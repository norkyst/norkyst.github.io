Norkyst coastal ocean forecasting system
=======================

**Norkyst** is the national coastal ocean forecasting system for Norway, which is based a specific configuration of the [Regional Ocean Modeling System](https://www.myroms.org/). The forecasting system Norkyst is developed and maintained jointly by the [Institute of Marine Research](https://hi.no) and the [Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway)](https://met.no). 

Norkyst version 3 will be made fully operational in 2024, and a set of tools for extracting and analysing output data from the model will be made available through github later on. Full model configurations will also be made available. Our aim is to encourage basic and applied research based on model outputs, and also to encourage collaborative developments to improve the forecast system itself.
